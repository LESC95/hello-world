# hello-world
I'm learning how to make digital projects as a tool to complement my marketing strategies.


Hi people!


My english is so bad, but I really want to explore the world of programing and make some functional tools to help some of my local clients


I like boba tea so much and support local coffe shops in Tijuana, B.C., Mexico
